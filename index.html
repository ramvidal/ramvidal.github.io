<div id="main-text"><p>Learning is at the core of everything I do. Whether it be improving my proficiency with Java or going out to meet fellow developers to get to know the field, I always focus on finding ways to improve myself. This website is the result of one such escapade.</p>
<p>In the past month (April 2019), I have earned a Pro Scrum Master certification. A result of a fruitful mentorship program by Columbus State Community College--thanks for all the help Bill! In that same college, I learned the basics of Java by creating multiple small programs designed to do things like store the imaginary movement of a car or convert a numerical grade to a letter grade.</p>
<p>As of the creation of this site, I am working on landing a junior software apprenticeship. Regardless of the outcome of the job search, I will continue to improve my skills while I transition from Columbus State Community College to Ohio State University.</p></div>
